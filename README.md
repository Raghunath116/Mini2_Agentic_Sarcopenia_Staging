# Mini‑2: Agentic AI for Multi‑Class Sarcopenia Staging

## Overview
This project aims to build an **agentic AI‑driven pipeline** for **multi‑class staging of sarcopenia** using **abdominal CT scans at the L3 vertebral level**.  
We will integrate **EfficientNet‑V2** for fine‑grained feature extraction and **Swin Transformer** for contextual representation learning.  
The pipeline is orchestrated using **Autogen agents** for data preprocessing, automated labeling, model training, and explainability generation.

---

## Objectives
- Develop an **agent‑orchestrated pipeline** for automated data processing and model training.
- Build a **hybrid deep learning model** (EfficientNet‑V2 + Swin Transformer) for multi‑class sarcopenia staging.
- Generate **explainable outputs** (Grad‑CAM) for clinical interpretability.
- Prepare a **conference‑ready mini‑paper** with figures and workflow diagrams.
